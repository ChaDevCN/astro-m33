They are designed to withstand wear and maintain their functionality for extended periods of time.<br />\nThe most <strong>wear-resistant materials</strong> are diamonds and sapphires, but they are scarce and expensive, making them unsuitable for most industrial applications. Instead, various alloys and engineered materials are used to provide wear resistance, such as:</p>\n\n<ul class=\"pro-ulli1\">\n\t<li>Wear-resistant steels with high carbon and manganese content</li>\n\t<li>Copper alloys like aluminum bronze, tin bronze, phosphor bronze, leaded bronze, and gunmetal</li>\n\t<li>Alloy irons, austenitic manganese steels, and hard bronzes</li>\n\t<li>Mineral, ceramic, and metallic materials like high-performance concrete, fused cast basalt, zirconium corundum ceramics, and silicon carbide ceramics</li>\n\t<li>The wear resistance of a material is influenced by factors such as hardness, lubricity, surface roughness, coefficient of friction, and the type of wear mechanism affecting the material. Proper lubrication and material selection based on the specific application and operating conditions are crucial for maximizing wear resistance.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Wear-resistant materials are essential in various industries, particularly in applications involving bearings, wear pads, wear plates, gears, rotating shafts, and components exposed to abrasive or sliding wear. Using wear-resistant materials can extend the lifetime of parts, improve efficiency, and enhance safety in machinery and equipment.</p>\n\n<p>Wear-resistant materials include: <a href=\"https://www.nhgrindingball.com/wear-resistant-materials/wear-resistant-casting\">Wear Resistant Casting</a>,<a href=\"https://www.nhgrindingball.com/wear-resistant-materials/ball-mill-alloy-liner\">Ball Mill Alloy Liner</a>,<a href=\"https://www.nhgrindingball.com/wear-resistant-materials/cast-iron-ball-mill-liners\">Cast Iron Ball Mill Liners</a>,<a href=\"https://www.nhgrindingball.com/wear-resistant-materials/casting-alloy-steel-hammer\">Casting Alloy Steel Hammer</a>,<a href=\"https://www.nhgrindingball.com/wear-resistant-materials/wear-resistant-casting-iron-steel-hammer\">Wear Resistant Casting Iron Steel Hammer</a>,<a href=\"https://www.nhgrindingball.com/wear-resistant-materials/alloy-steel-casting\">Alloy Steel Casting</a>.</p>\n\n<p>NINGHU is a leading Wear-Resistant Materials Manufacturer and Supplier, offering precision Wear-Resistant Materials for higher efficiency.

They are designed to withstand wear and maintain their functionality for extended periods of time.<br />\nThe most <strong>wear-resistant materials</strong> are diamonds and sapphires, but they are scarce and expensive, making them unsuitable for most industrial applications. Instead, various alloys and engineered materials are used to provide wear resistance, such as:</p>\n\n<ul class=\"pro-ulli1\">\n\t<li>Wear-resistant steels with high carbon and manganese content</li>\n\t<li>Copper alloys like aluminum bronze, tin bronze, phosphor bronze, leaded bronze, and gunmetal</li>\n\t<li>Alloy irons, austenitic manganese steels, and hard bronzes</li>\n\t<li>Mineral, ceramic, and metallic materials like high-performance concrete, fused cast basalt, zirconium corundum ceramics, and silicon carbide ceramics</li>\n\t<li>The wear resistance of a material is influenced by factors such as hardness, lubricity, surface roughness, coefficient of friction, and the type of wear mechanism affecting the material. Proper lubrication and material selection based on the specific application and operating conditions are crucial for maximizing wear resistance.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Wear-resistant materials are essential in various industries, particularly in applications involving bearings, wear pads, wear plates, gears, rotating shafts, and components exposed to abrasive or sliding wear. Using wear-resistant materials can extend the lifetime of parts, improve efficiency, and enhance safety in machinery and equipment.</p>\n\n<p>Wear-resistant materials include: <a href=\"https://www.nhgrindingball.com/wear-resistant-materials/wear-resistant-casting\">Wear Resistant Casting</a>,<a href=\"https://www.nhgrindingball.com/wear-resistant-materials/ball-mill-alloy-liner\">Ball Mill Alloy Liner</a>,<a href=\"https://www.nhgrindingball.com/wear-resistant-materials/cast-iron-ball-mill-liners\">Cast Iron Ball Mill Liners</a>,<a href=\"https://www.nhgrindingball.com/wear-resistant-materials/casting-alloy-steel-hammer\">Casting Alloy Steel Hammer</a>,<a href=\"https://www.nhgrindingball.com/wear-resistant-materials/wear-resistant-casting-iron-steel-hammer\">Wear Resistant Casting Iron Steel Hammer</a>,<a href=\"https://www.nhgrindingball.com/wear-resistant-materials/alloy-steel-casting\">Alloy Steel Casting</a>.</p>\n\n<p>NINGHU is a leading Wear-Resistant Materials Manufacturer and Supplier, offering precision Wear-Resistant Materials for higher efficiency.

Impact toughness plays a critical role in determining the durability and efficiency of grinding balls under harsh operating conditions.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"grinding ball\" title=\"grinding ball\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" src=\"/icms/upload/697f4940e81911ee9f4c896939108d74/ckftpdata/images/2024629/1719623113808/upload_41c366f65f2a61f8bc670959854de3cc.webp?size=600x0\" /></p>\n\n<h2><strong>How is Impact Toughness Defined for Grinding Balls?</strong></h2>\n\n<p>In the realm of grinding balls, the term &quot;impact toughness&quot; denotes the capacity of a material to withstand and endure the effects of impact without succumbing to fracture. This characteristic is of paramount importance given the harsh conditions that <strong>grinding ball</strong>s encounter within mills. The balls are continually bombarded with high-energy impacts as they come into forceful contact with ore particles and other abrasive materials in the pursuit of size reduction.</p>\n\n<p>Grinding balls that possess high impact toughness are better equipped to handle these impacts, absorbing significant amounts of energy during collisions without shattering. This resilience not only preserves the structural integrity of the grinding balls but also extends their operational lifespan, which is a critical factor in maintaining the efficiency and reducing the costs associated with grinding operations.</p>\n\n<p>The measurement of impact toughness is typically conducted through standardized tests that subject the material to a controlled impact force. One common method is the Charpy or Izod impact test, where a notched specimen of the material is struck with a pendulum hammer, and the energy absorbed during the fracture is measured. The results provide a quantitative assessment of the material&#39;s ability to resist breakage under impact.</p>\n\n<p>Recognizing the significance of impact toughness in grinding ball performance is vital for several reasons. Firstly, it aids in the selection of materials that are best suited for the rigors of the grinding environment. By choosing materials with high impact toughness, manufacturers can produce grinding balls that are more durable and less prone to failure.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, understanding impact toughness can guide the development of improved grinding ball designs and manufacturing processes. For instance, advanced heat treatments or alloying elements can be employed to enhance the impact toughness of the grinding balls, thereby improving their performance in service.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, the knowledge of impact toughness can inform the operational strategies within mills.

The rate at which these grinding balls are consumed has a direct bearing on the operational costs, as it influences the frequency of replacement and the associated expenses.</p>\n\n<p>Calculating the consumption of grinding balls is not merely an academic exercise; it is a practical necessity. It offers invaluable insights into the operational efficiency of the grinding process. By understanding the factors that contribute to grinding ball wear and by quantifying the rate of consumption, mining engineers can make informed decisions to optimize the process.</p>\n\n<p>To calculate grinding ball consumption, one must consider several variables, including the hardness and size of the ore, the size and material of the grinding balls, the mill&#39;s operating conditions, and the duration of the grinding process. The formula typically involves the estimation of the wear rate of the grinding balls, which can be expressed as a function of the ore&#39;s grindability and the energy input into the mill.</p>\n\n<p>By closely monitoring the consumption rates and correlating them with the throughput and efficiency of the mill, operators can identify areas for improvement. For instance, adjustments in the mill&#39;s operational parameters, such as the speed, the ball charge ratio, or the liner configuration, can be made to enhance the performance and longevity of the grinding balls.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, the analysis of grinding ball consumption data can guide the selection of more wear-resistant materials or the implementation of advanced grinding technologies, which could lead to a reduction in the overall cost of grinding media over time.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>What factors affect grinding ball consumption?</strong></h2>\n\n<p>The utilization of <strong>grinding ball</strong>s in mills is subject to a multitude of influencing factors that necessitate careful consideration to enhance grinding efficiency and minimize operational expenditures. Among these factors are the intrinsic properties of the ore, such as its hardness, the size of the feed, and its grindability. Additionally, characteristics of the mill itself, including its rotational velocity, the design of its liners, and the diameter of the grinding balls, play a significant role. Operating conditions, such as the load within the mill and the rate of wear on the grinding media, are also pivotal.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, the hardness of the ore has a direct bearing on the efficiency of the grinding process. Ores with greater hardness necessitate a higher energy expenditure to reach the target particle size, which in turn escalates the rate at which the grinding media degrades. The rotational speed of the mill is another critical variable; higher speeds typically lead to more substantial impact forces as the ore collides with the grinding media, thereby hastening the wear process.</p>\n\n<p>The dimensions and configuration of the grinding media are equally influential on both the efficiency of the grinding and the rate of wear. While smaller grinding balls tend to provide superior grinding efficiency, they also tend to succumb to wear more rapidly.</p>\n\n<p>A thorough understanding of these factors demands an in-depth examination of the particular ore undergoing processing, alongside a meticulous assessment of the mill&#39;s operational parameters. Implementing wear-resistant materials for the grinding media and fine-tuning the distribution of ball sizes are strategies that can counteract some of these influences, leading to a decrease in the long-term consumption of grinding balls.</p>\n\n<p>By leveraging this knowledge, industries can tailor their grinding operations to better suit the specific demands of their ores and mills. This includes selecting the appropriate hardness and size of grinding balls, adjusting mill speeds to balance efficiency with wear, and managing the mill load to distribute forces effectively. Moreover, the implementation of advanced monitoring technologies can provide real-time insights into the wear of grinding media, enabling preemptive actions to prolong their service life.</p>\n\n<p>In essence, optimizing the consumption of grinding balls in mills is a multifaceted endeavor that encompasses the consideration of ore characteristics, mill features, and operational dynamics. Through strategic material selection, process optimization, and continuous monitoring, industries can achieve more sustainable and cost-effective grinding operations.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>How to calculate grinding ball consumption per ton of ore processed?</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Calculating the <strong>grinding ball </strong>consumption when processing a given ore type is crucial for optimizing operational costs and mill performance.

Understanding the components that add to the wear speed of devastating balls is crucial for working on smashing errands and restricting help costs. In this broad guide, we plunge into the key components affecting squashing ball wear rate, giving encounters maintained by investigation and industry capacity.</p>\n\n<h2>Material Composition of Grinding Balls</h2>\n\n<p>The material composition of the balls plays a significant role in determining their wear rate. The wear pace of the <strong>grinding ball</strong> fundamentally affects creation productivity and cost-adequacy in different modern cycles. In this broad guide, we plunge into the key components affecting squashing ball wear rate, giving encounters maintained by investigation and industry capacity.</p>\n\n<h2>Grinding Ball Hardness</h2>\n\n<p>Hardness is a critical factor influencing the wear resistance of the balls. Harder balls tend to withstand abrasive forces better than softer ones, resulting in lower wear rates over time. The Rockwell hardness or Brinell hardness of the&nbsp;<strong>grinding ball</strong>&nbsp;provides valuable insights into their resistance to deformation and abrasion during grinding operations. Manufacturers often optimize the hardness of the balls based on the specific requirements of the application and the type of material being processed.</p>\n\n<h2>Operating Conditions and Grinding Environment</h2>\n\n<p>The operating conditions and grinding environment significantly impact the wear rate of the balls. Factors such as the speed of rotation, grinding media load, temperature, and pH level of the slurry can affect the abrasive wear and corrosion of the balls. High-temperature environments or corrosive chemical conditions can accelerate wear rates, necessitating careful selection of grinding media and operational parameters to mitigate excessive wear and maintain process efficiency.</p>\n\n<h2>Particle Size Distribution and Grinding Media Interactions</h2>\n\n<p>The particle size distribution (PSD) in a grinding process is influenced by various factors, including the characteristics of the material being ground, the grinding equipment used, and the properties of the grinding media. Grinding media interactions play a significant role in determining the final PSD and overall efficiency of the grinding process. Here&rsquo;s how these interactions typically unfold.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"pro-ulli1\">\n\t<li>\n\t<h3>Material Properties</h3>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Hardness:</strong> Harder materials require more energy for size reduction, affecting the selection of grinding media and impacting wear rates.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Brittleness:</strong> Brittle materials tend to fracture easily, resulting in finer particle sizes, but excessive brittleness can lead to increased wear of grinding media.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Moisture Content: </strong>Moist materials may agglomerate or become sticky during&nbsp;<strong>grinding ball</strong>, affecting the PSD and requiring adjustments in grinding parameters or media selection.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"pro-ulli1\">\n\t<li>\n\t<h3>Grinding Equipment</h3>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Type of Mill:</strong> Different types of mills (e.g., ball mills, hammer mills, roller mills) have varying mechanisms of action that influence PSD.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mill Speed and Residence Time:</strong> These parameters affect the degree of grinding and the PSD by controlling the energy input and the duration of material residence in the mill.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mill Design and Liner Configuration: </strong>The design of the mill and the shape of the grinding chamber can impact particle trajectories and residence time, influencing PSD.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"pro-ulli1\">\n\t<li>\n\t<h3>Grinding Media</h3>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Size and Shape: </strong>Smaller media tend to produce finer particles, while larger media contribute to coarser PSDs. Additionally, irregularly shaped media may induce more efficient breakage compared to spherical media.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Material Composition: </strong>Different materials of grinding media (e.g., steel, ceramic, or polymer) have varying hardness, wear resistance, and impact properties, influencing their effectiveness in particle size reduction.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Density and Packing Density: </strong>Media density affects the energy transfer and impact forces within the mill, influencing grinding efficiency and PSD.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Media Wear: </strong>As grinding media wear, their size and shape change, impacting grinding efficiency and PSD. Additionally, worn media can introduce contamination into the product, affecting its quality.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"pro-ulli1\">\n\t<li>\n\t<h3>Interactions</h3>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Abrasion and Impact: </strong>The grinding media continuously interact with the material being ground through abrasion and impact, leading to size reduction. The frequency and intensity of these interactions depend on factors like mill speed, media size, and material properties.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Attrition and Agglomeration: </strong>Fine particles may agglomerate due to adhesive forces or attrition, affecting the PSD. The presence of grinding media can break down agglomerates, influencing the final particle size distribution.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Media-Media Interactions: </strong>Collisions between grinding media can affect the grinding kinetics and PSD, especially in high-energy mills where media collisions contribute significantly to particle breakage.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"pro-ulli1\">\n\t<li>\n\t<h3>Importance</h3>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Understanding the communications between crushing media and molecule size dissemination is urgent for enhancing crushing cycles concerning effectiveness, item quality, and energy utilization. By choosing the suitable crushing media and changing cycle boundaries, producers can accomplish the ideal PSD for their particular applications. Furthermore, bits of knowledge into media-material connections can support the advancement of more effective crushing innovations and media details.</p>\n\n<h2>Maintenance Practices and Quality Control Measures</h2>\n\n<p>Effective maintenance practices and quality control measures are essential for managing <strong>grinding ball</strong> wear rates and ensuring optimal performance over time. Wearing or damaged the balls can be replaced, monitored, and inspected regularly, assisting in the prevention of process interruptions and consistent grinding efficiency. Besides, carrying out quality control measures during the assembling system, like thorough testing and adherence to industry guidelines, guarantees the solidness and dependability of crushing balls in requested working conditions.</p>\n\n<p>With everything taken into account, supporting practical viability and smoothing out pounding cycles in different present day applications requires an understanding of the factors that influence the devastating ball wear rate. By considering the material&#39;s sythesis, hardness, working circumstances, molecule size circulation, and upkeep practices, makers and administrators can diminish unreasonable wear, lessen free time, and work on by and large efficiency.</p>\n\n<p>Contact us today for professional manufacturing solutions.

Dissimilar to different types of projecting, combination steel projecting explicitly uses steel composites, which are mixes of iron and different components like carbon, manganese, chromium, or nickel. These combinations are picked for their ideal mechanical properties, including strength, hardness, erosion opposition, and wear obstruction. Amalgam steel projecting is generally utilized in different businesses, including auto, aviation, development, and assembling, because of its flexibility and solidness.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Importance of Casting Techniques:Casting techniques play a vital role in the production of high-quality alloy steel components. The efficiency and precision of these techniques directly impact the final product&#39;s mechanical properties, dimensional accuracy, and surface finish. By employing advanced casting techniques, manufacturers can optimize production processes, minimize material waste, and ensure consistent product quality. Moreover, casting techniques enable the creation of complex geometries and intricate designs that may be challenging or impossible to achieve through other manufacturing methods.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Brief History：The history of amalgam steel casting can be followed back thousands of a long time to old civilizations such as Mesopotamia, Egypt, and China, where early shapes of casting strategies were utilized to deliver metal artifacts and apparatuses. Be that as it may, it was not until the Mechanical Transformation in the 18th and 19th centuries that casting strategies experienced critical headways, driven by developments in metallurgy, designing, and fabricating innovation. The development of alloy steel alloys further revolutionized the casting industry, enabling the production of stronger, more durable components for a wide range of applications.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Basic Principles：At its core, the steel casting involves several fundamental principles that govern the transformation of molten metal into solidified components. These principles include the selection of appropriate alloy compositions, the creation of precise molds or patterns, the control of casting parameters such as temperature and pressure, and the implementation of quality assurance measures to ensure the integrity of the final product.

Ventures that depend intensely on wear-safe steel incorporate mining and development, where hardware and designs are exposed to tireless mileage.</p>\n\n<p>A few normal uses of scraped spot safe steel include:</p>\n\n<p>Mining and Digging Gear: Parts, for example, cans for diggers and tractors, liners for dump trucks, and connections for tractors benefit from the prevalent toughness of wear-safe steel.</p>\n\n<p>Transport Frameworks: Wear-safe steel finds broad use in transport lines, which are crucial for moving materials proficiently in modern settings.</p>\n\n<p>Material Dealing with Hardware: Liners for receptacles, chutes, and containers in enterprises like mining and concrete are frequently produced using scraped spot safe steel to endure the rough powers applied by streaming materials.</p>\n\n<p>By integrating wear-safe steel into these applications, businesses can fundamentally expand the life expectancy of their gear and lessen support costs related with incessant substitutions.</p>\n\n<h2>What is the Difference Between Hardness and Wear Resistance?</h2>\n\n<p>While hardness and <strong>wear-resistant casting</strong> are connected ideas, they allude to unmistakable properties of materials. Hardness, with regards to materials science, gauges a material&#39;s capacity to oppose twisting when exposed to outside powers, like pressure or space. It is many times measured utilizing state sanctioned tests like the Rockwell or Brinell hardness scales.</p>\n\n<p>Then again, wear obstruction relates to a material&#39;s capacity to endure scraped spot, disintegration, or contact prompted harm over the long run. While hardness adds to wear protection from some degree, it isn&#39;t the sole determinant. Different elements, for example, microstructure, organization, and surface medicines, likewise impact a material&#39;s protection from wear.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, a material might show high hardness yet unfortunate wear obstruction on the off chance that its microstructure is defenseless to microcracking or on the other hand assuming it needs adequate grease properties. On the other hand, a material with moderate hardness yet enhanced microstructure and structure might exhibit unrivaled wear obstruction.</p>\n\n<p>Fundamentally, while hardness gives a sign of a material&#39;s protection from disfigurement, wear obstruction envelops its capacity to keep up with its honesty and usefulness in grating conditions, making it a vital thought in the choice of materials for high-wear applications.</p>\n\n<h2>What is Meant by Wear Resistance?</h2>\n\n<p>Wear opposition alludes to the capacity of a material to endure scraped spot, disintegration, or erosion instigated debasement over the long haul. In pragmatic terms, a wear-safe material can keep up with its surface trustworthiness and useful properties in any event, when exposed to tedious contact with rough substances or surfaces.</p>\n\n<p>The idea of wear obstruction is especially applicable in businesses where gear and parts are presented to unforgiving working circumstances, like consistent movement, material stream, or rough conditions. By choosing materials with high wear obstruction, makers can drag out the life expectancy of their items, limit free time because of support or substitutions, and eventually decrease working expenses.</p>\n\n<p>Factors impacting wear obstruction include:</p>\n\n<p>Material Organization: The synthetic creation of a material assumes a huge part in deciding its wear obstruction. Alloying components can upgrade hardness, sturdiness, and different properties basic for opposing wear.</p>\n\n<p>Microstructure: The inward design of a material, including grain size, circulation of stages, and presence of deformities, significantly influences its protection from wear. Fine-grained materials with uniform microstructures will quite often display preferable wear obstruction over coarse-grained partners.</p>\n\n<p>Surface Medicines: Surface medicines like coatings, heat medicines, and surface changes can further develop a material&#39;s wear obstruction by improving surface hardness, diminishing grinding, or giving a defensive hindrance against rough specialists.</p>\n\n<p>In outline, wear obstruction is a vital trait of materials utilized in high-wear applications, guaranteeing the life span and dependability of parts and gear exposed to rough powers.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p><strong>wear-resistant casting</strong>, especially as scraped spot safe steel, assumes a crucial part in enterprises where gear and designs face consistent scraped spot and wear.</p>\n\n<p>By grasping the properties of wear-safe steel, the contrast among hardness and wear opposition, and the idea of wear obstruction itself, ventures can go with informed choices in regards to material determination, prompting further developed execution, solidness, and cost-viability.</p>\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n\n<ol class=\"pro-ulli1\">\n\t<li>&quot;Abrasion Resistant Steel Uses.&quot; American Iron and Steel Institute, www.steel.org/resources/steel-industry-resources/end-use-statistics/steel-use-in-the-mining-industry.aspx.</li>\n\t<li>Kalwa, Cristopher. &quot;Understanding the Difference Between Hardness and Wear Resistance.&quot; AZoM, 10 May 2023, www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=19978.</li>\n\t<li>&quot;Wear Resistance.&quot; ASM International, www.asminternational.org/materials-resources/industrial-spotlight/spotlight-on-the-industrial-materials-community/spotlight-on-wear-resistance.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n","labels":"[]","provider_id":"ipadmin","provider":"智慧运营","generate_type":"ai","generate_type2":"import","key1":"","key2":"","key3":"","key4":"","key5":"","ask_numbers":0,"check_name":"编辑经理","check_time":"2024-05-15 17:07:40","check_userid":"9206a730493411edaf4d23ca7886ae5e","className":"Knowledge","confirm_name":"编辑经理","create_timestamp":1715828572000,"description":"Wear-resistant casting plays a crucial role in numerous industries, particularly in sectors like mining and construction where materials constantly face abrasion.","glProductIds":["61fd8c07f65a11ee8b50dfb9f4d995be","61fe767cf65a11ee8b50dfb9f4d995be","61fd16eff65a11ee8b50dfb9f4d995be","61fd16d4f65a11ee8b50dfb9f4d995be","61fd650cf65a11ee8b50dfb9f4d995be","61fe284af65a11ee8b50dfb9f4d995be","61fd8c0df65a11ee8b50dfb9f4d995be","61fd6506f65a11ee8b50dfb9f4d995be"],"keywords":"软文标题","managerids":["697f7052e81911ee9f4c896939108d74"],"managers":["nhgrinding"],"path":"/knowledge/what-is-wear-resistant-casting-and-how-does-it-work-","public_name":"nhgrinding","student_name":"","teacher_name":"","title":"软文标题 - NINGHU","updateTime":"2024-06-18 10:56:08","update_timestamp":1717403235000,"confirm_time":"2024-05-15 17:36:55","confirm_userid":"9206a730493411edaf4d23ca7886ae5e","knowledgePic":"/icms/upload/697f4940e81911ee9f4c896939108d74/pic/软文管理-软文图片/76e309b010f411ef9f592f5ec6c6dedd/Directory/wear-resistant castings.webp","public_userid":"697f7052e81911ee9f4c896939108d74","glKnowledgeIds":["0d55c8c214fa11efb9aadb59b3f5f56a","e15805b1140c11efb9aadb59b3f5f56a","e15805ad140c11efb9aadb59b3f5f56a","e15805a7140c11efb9aadb59b3f5f56a","54c0f3c0f61d11eeae5a45cba6c73e9b","e15805a9140c11efb9aadb59b3f5f56a","76e330c010f411ef9f592f5ec6c6dedd","d906fe30f61e11eeae5a45cba6c73e9b","e157de95140c11efb9aadb59b3f5f56a","709b28300e6f11efa09cbbec2c6d3306"],"optimize":true},{"_id":"6641bc7ea408a84d70086594","ID":"220b4d6010f611efb03f0fca2e8660c1","className":"Knowledge","content":"<h2>What is alloy steel casting?</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nhgrindingball.com/wear-resistant-materials\"><strong>Alloy steel casting</strong></a> is an assembling cycle used to deliver complex metal parts with explicit properties by softening composite steel and emptying it into a pre-planned shape.
